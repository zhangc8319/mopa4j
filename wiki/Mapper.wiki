This class gives you the capability to convert any _POJOs_ to a _com.mongodb.DBObject_ and vice-versa. 
In this case for POJO we intend POJO IS [ADocumentObject].

It was the first class written at all. After few ours I got the basic to convert my pojos in DBObjects and vice-versa.

After a couple of days I need it to add more features like mapping and converting nested pojos.
