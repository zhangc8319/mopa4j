= Introduction =

This class provides three basic methods to query your documents on the database:
{{{
    public List<T> find();
    public List<T> find(QueryObject queryObject);
    public T findOne(QueryObject queryObject);
}}}

You just need to write your own query manager extending QueryManager giving it your data type you want to query to.

Let's say you have a class like this:

{{{
public class User {

  private String name;
  private Date birthdate;

  ...getters/setters...
}
}}}

First make your User class extend ADocumentObject :

{{{
public class User extends ADocumentObject {
 ...
}
}}}

then write down your typed query manager:

{{{
public class UserQueryManager extends QueryManager<User> {

}
}}}

Now you can query your User object/document by providing a QueryObject.
