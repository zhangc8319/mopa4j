= Details =

You just need to write your own persistence manager extending PersistenceManager giving it your data type you want to operate with.

Let's say you have a class like this:

public class User {
  private String name;

  private Date birthdate;

  ...getters/setters...
}

First make your User class extend ADocumentObject, then write down your typed persistence manager:

public class User extends ADocumentObject {

}

'public class UserPersistenceManager extends PersistenceManager<User> {

}'

Now you can CRUD your user object/document.
Remember that the _public T read(T aDocumentObject)_ method looks for the *_id* puery your data on db.
