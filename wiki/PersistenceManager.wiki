This class provides the basic for creating, reading, updating and deleting a document to/from your MongoDB instance.

You just need to write your own persistence manager extending PersistenceManager giving it your data type you want to operate with.

Let's say you have a class like this:

{{{
public class User {

  private String name;
  private Date birthdate;

  ...getters/setters...
}
}}}

First make your User class extend ADocumentObject:

{{{
public class User extends ADocumentObject {
 ...
}
}}}

then write down your typed persistence manager:

{{{
public class UserPersistenceManager extends PersistenceManager < User > {

}
}}}

Now you can CRUD your User object/document.

Remember that the 
{{{
public T read(T aDocumentObject);
}}}
method of the PersistenceManager looks for the *_id* to query your data on the database.
